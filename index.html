            <h2>About Crystal's Interest</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Crystal, and I watch a lot of tv shows and movies. 
                I used to love watching these mediums because I wanted to be an actress, 
                but now I love observing these films as an art form and mode of expression. 
                I particularly like sitcoms and cheesy dramas, but for movies I love psycho-thrillers and comedies. </p>
            <p>What I love about movies is that they can transport you to other worlds. 
                “Movie Magic” makes things like green witches and superpowers real, 
                at least for 2 hours and 30 minutes. Director's and writer's wildest 
                imaginations run rampant all over a script that places viewers in a reality other than their own.</p>
            <p>It isn't just actors either, I love learning all about the production process behind movies. 
                The costumes, the makeup, the sets, the writing, the music, 
                and everything else that goes into making movies and tv shows is so intriguing to me.
                 I think there is a lot to be learned from the coordination and organization necessary 
                 to make any of these projects happen. Not only that, but I love seeing people that clearly 
                 love their job and do it because they're meant to do it, not because they have to.  </p>
